# Stripped down version of erlcloud: Cloud Computing APIs For Erlang #

> `httpc` have been replaced with `ibrowse`

Service APIs implemented:

- Amazon SimpleDB

All API functions have been implemented.  Not all functions
have been thoroughly tested, so exercise care when integrating
this library into production code.  Please send bug reports and patches.

The libraries can be used two ways: either you can specify configuration
parameters in the process dictionary, or you can create a configuration object
and pass that to each request as the final parameter.

## Getting started ##

Refer to the documentation in the master branch.
